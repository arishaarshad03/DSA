# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains **C++ programs implementing basic sorting algorithms**. Each program demonstrates a different method to sort an array of integers, helping to understand algorithm logic and performance differences.

## Programs

| File | Algorithm | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `bubblesort.cpp` | Bubble Sort | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Includes optimization to stop early if the array is already sorted. |
| `insertionsort.cpp` | Insertion Sort | Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position. Efficient for nearly sorted arrays. |
| `selectionsort.cpp` | Selection Sort | Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning. |

## Features

- Each program sorts an array of integers entered by the user.  
- Programs demonstrate **fundamental sorting logic**.  
- Optimizations like early stopping are included in bubble sort.  
- All programs output the **sorted array**.
