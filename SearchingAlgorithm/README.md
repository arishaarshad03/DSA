# Searching Algorithms

This folder contains **C++ programs implementing basic searching algorithms**. Each program demonstrates a method to search for a target element in an array, helping to understand linear and binary search techniques.

## Programs

| File | Algorithm | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `linearsearch.cpp` | Linear Search | Searches for a target element by checking each element in the array sequentially. Works on **unsorted arrays**. |
| `binarysearch.cpp` | Binary Search | Searches for a target element by repeatedly dividing the search range in half. Requires a **sorted array**. |

## Features

- Linear search works for **any array**, sorted or unsorted.  
- Binary search is **faster** but requires a **sorted array**.  
- Programs print the **index/position of the target value** if found.  
- Handles cases where the target value does not exist.
