# Course Management System – C++ (Linked List)

A **menu-driven Course Management System** implemented in **C++ using singly linked lists**.  
This program manages **courses and their enrolled students**, allowing insertion, deletion, searching, and display operations.

This project is mainly focused on **practicing Data Structures concepts** such as linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, and pointer handling.

## Features

### Course Operations
- Add new course  
- Delete a course  
- Search for a course  
- Display all available courses  

### Student Operations
- Enroll student in a course  
- Remove student from a specific course  
- Search student in a course  
- Search student in all courses  
- Delete student from all courses  

### Display
- Display all courses with their enrolled students  
- Display students of a particular course

## Data Structure Used

Each **course node** contains:
- Course number
- Pointer to next course
- Pointer to a **linked list of students**

Each **student node** contains:
- Student seat number
- Pointer to next student  

This forms a **nested linked list structure**.

## Menu Interface
1. Insert a new course

2. Insert student into a course

3. Display all courses and students

4. Display students of a specific course

5. Search for a course

6. Display all courses

7. Remove a course

8. Remove a student from a course

9. Search student in a course

10. Search student in all courses

11. Delete student from all courses

12. Exit
