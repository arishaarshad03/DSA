# Stack Implementations in C++

This folder contains two different implementations of the **Stack data structure** in C++. Both demonstrate the core operations of a stack, including **Push**, **Pop**, and **Display** operations.

## 📌 Implemented Stack Types

1. **Array-Based Stack** (`stack_array.cpp`)
   - Uses a fixed-size array to store stack elements.
   - Operations:
     - Push (add element to top)
     - Pop (remove element from top)
     - Display (bottom to top and top to bottom)
   - Demonstrates **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** behavior with static memory.

2. **Linked List-Based Stack** (`stack_linkedlist.cpp`)
   - Uses a dynamically allocated linked list to store elements.
   - Operations:
     - Push (add element to top)
     - Pop (remove element from top)
     - Display (top to bottom; can be extended to bottom-to-top using recursion)
   - Allows **dynamic memory allocation** and no fixed size limitation.
