# Hash Table Implementation in C++

This project demonstrates **hash table implementation in C++** using different collision resolution techniques. It covers **Linear Probing**, **Quadratic Probing**, and **Separate Chaining**.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Linear Probing:** Handles collisions by checking the next available index in a linear manner.
- **Quadratic Probing:** Resolves collisions using a quadratic function to reduce clustering.
- **Separate Chaining:** Uses linked lists at each index to store multiple keys that hash to the same slot.
